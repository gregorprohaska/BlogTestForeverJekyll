## the blog

This blog is dedicated to all things related with Data & Analytics, especially ETL, SQL, Power BI modelling and DAX. Most of the content is based on real-world examples or (at leaste) inspired by. 

... and of course it should be a place where I can store and collect all the little helpers I use all the time. :-)

## me

### short:

what describes me best: ...

 **I am genuinely curios :-)**

### a little bit longer:

I startet my journey in Data & Analytics in 2007 as a consultant for financial planning. One of my first tasks was to create a generic import framework to simplify the data load into our tool - I loved it! The moment when the pieces fall into place gave (and still do give) me real joy. I'm deeply gratefull to my then-bosses which gave me the space to learn, practice, make mistakes and finally succeed (sometimes ;-)).

Fast-forward... today I'm still a consultant and work with some of the same colleagues, but my focus shifted. From financial planning to SSAS Multidimensional to SSAS Tabular and Power BI, all based on "good ol' DWH" architecture principles and solid ETL\ELT-Processes. Furthermore, since 2019 I do have the pleasure to lead a team of business intelligence\Data&Analytics-Experts as part of a consulting company with 1300+ employees.
